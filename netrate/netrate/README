This progam monitors the network traffic on the network interfaces connected to
your computer, displaying a nice textmode graphical output of the average
traffic.

netrate runs on the following systems
 Linux 2.4 and 2.6 (as a normal user)
 FreeBSD 2.2.x, 3.5.x (should work on all 3.x), 4.x, 5.x (only as root)
 NetBSD 1.6.x (only as root)
 OpenBSD 3.3, 3.4 (only as root)

netrate was only tested on x86 platforms should work fine on 64bit platforms 
as well, but I haven't yet tested
