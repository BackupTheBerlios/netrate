2000-03-01  Alexandru Popa  <razor@ldc.ro>

	* Upped version number to 0.07
	* Added commandline options support
	* Changed look of display: now you get the interface name and
	transfer rates directly above the bars for that interface.

2000-02-22  Alex Popa  <razor@ldc.ro>

	* Upped the version number to 0.06 (not released/announced due to
	network access problems)
	* Added MIN_RATE and changed the minimum transfer rate to
	1k/second. This should stop the annoying skips in the bars on an
	almost idle machine, that receives few packets (like 10-50
	bytes/sec)
	* Changed the imports so I get only the functions I need
	* Fixed annoying bug - incorrect parsing on a 2.0.38 kernel, with
	aliased interfaces.  I previously parsed looking where the ":"
	was, now I get the first 6 chars as the interface name, and the
	rest as the values for the transfers.
